# feathericons

The goal of {feathericons} is to give access to feathericons svg icons in Shiny. 

More about Feather Icons on <https://feathericons.com/>

## Installation

You can install the released version of feathericons from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ColinFay/feathericons")
```

## How to use

You'll need to call `use_feather_icons` in your Shiny UI. Then, an icon is added with `feather_icons`, which takes as arguments the name of the icon

```{r example}
library(shiny)
library(feathericons)

ui <- fluidPage(
  use_feather_icons(), 
  tags$p(feather_icons("circle"), "Log in")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## List of icons 

The list is available as a vector: 

```{r eval = TRUE}
feathericons::icons_list
```

## All current supported icons : 

Run this chunk to get all supported icons and the results:

```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  use_feather_icons(),
  lapply(icons_list, function(x){
    HTML(feather_icons(x), ":", x)
    }
    )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
