# feathericons

The goal of {feathericons} is to give access to feathericons svg icons
in Shiny.

More about Feather Icons on <https://feathericons.com/>

## Installation

You can install the dev version of feathericons from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ColinFay/feathericons")
```

## How to use

Youâ€™ll need to call `use_feather_icons` in your Shiny UI. Then, an icon
is added with `feather_icons`, which takes as arguments the name of the
icon.

``` r
library(shiny)
library(feathericons)

ui <- fluidPage(
  use_feather_icons(), 
  tags$p(feather_icons("circle"), "Log in")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## List of icons

The list is available as a vector:
